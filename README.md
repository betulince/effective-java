This repository features code snippets I collected from "Effective Java, 3rd Edition."

Some of the code in this repository may not exactly match the code in the book. Additionally, I have made some personal modifications and added extra methods to the original version in certain places.

My main goal is to understand best practices in Java and learn concepts that I have not yet explored.
